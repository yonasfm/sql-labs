-- Clue #1: We recently got word that someone fitting Carmen Sandiego's description has been traveling through Southern Europe. She's most likely traveling someplace where she won't be noticed, so find the least populated country in Southern Europe, and we'll start looking for her there.

SELECT name, code, population
FROM country
WHERE region = 'Southern Europe'
ORDER BY population ASC
LIMIT 1;

-- Answer #1: The least populated country in Southern Europe is Vatican City State.
--  name              | code | population
-- -----------------------------+------+------------
--  Holy See (Vatican City State) | VAT  |       1000


-- Clue #2: Now that we're here, we have insight that Carmen was seen attending language classes in this country's officially recognized language. Check our databases and find out what language is spoken in this country, so we can call in a translator to work with you.

SELECT language
FROM countrylanguage
WHERE countrycode = 'VAT' AND isofficial = TRUE;

-- Answer #2: The official language of Vatican City State is Italian.
--  language
-- ----------
--  Italian


-- Clue #3: We have new news on the classes Carmen attended – our gumshoes tell us she's moved on to a different country, a country where people speak only the language she was learning. Find out which nearby country speaks nothing but that language.
-- Note: We'll look for countries where Italian is the only language listed in the database.

SELECT c.name, c.code
FROM country c
JOIN countrylanguage cl ON c.code = cl.countrycode
WHERE cl.language = 'Italian'
  AND c.code IN (
    SELECT countrycode
    FROM countrylanguage
    GROUP BY countrycode
    HAVING COUNT(language) = 1
  );

-- Answer #3: San Marino is a country where Italian is the only listed language.
--     name    | code
-- ------------+------
--  San Marino | SMR


-- Clue #4: We're booking the first flight out – maybe we've actually got a chance to catch her this time. There are only two cities she could be flying to in the country. One is named the same as the country – that would be too obvious. We're following our gut on this one; find out what other city in that country she might be flying to.

SELECT ci.name
FROM city ci
JOIN country co ON ci.countrycode = co.code
WHERE ci.countrycode = 'SMR' AND ci.name != co.name;

-- Answer #4: The other city in San Marino is Serravalle.
--     name
-- ------------
--  Serravalle


-- Clue #5: Oh no, she pulled a switch – there are two cities with very similar names, but in totally different parts of the globe! She's headed to South America as we speak; go find a city whose name is like the one we were headed to, but doesn't end the same. Find out the city, and do another search for what country it's in. Hurry!
-- We're looking for a city starting with 'Serra' but not ending in 'valle', located in South America.

SELECT ci.name AS city_name, co.name AS country_name, co.code AS country_code
FROM city ci
JOIN country co ON ci.countrycode = co.code
WHERE co.continent = 'South America'
  AND ci.name LIKE 'Serra%'
  AND ci.name NOT LIKE '%valle';

-- Answer #5: The city is Serra in Brazil.
--  city_name | country_name | country_code
-- -----------+--------------+--------------
--  Serra     | Brazil       | BRA


-- Clue #6: We're close! Our South American agent says she just got a taxi at the airport, and is headed towards the capital! Look up the country's capital, and get there pronto! Send us the name of where you're headed and we'll follow right behind you!

SELECT ci.name
FROM city ci
JOIN country co ON ci.capital = ci.id
WHERE co.code = 'BRA';

-- Answer #6: The capital of Brazil is Brasília.
--     name
-- ------------
--  Brasília


-- Clue #7: She knows we're on to her – her taxi dropped her off at the international airport, and she beat us to the boarding gates. We have one chance to catch her, we just have to know where she's heading and beat her to the landing dock.
-- Lucky for us, she's getting cocky. She left us a note, and I'm sure she thinks she's very clever, but if we can crack it, we can finally put her where she belongs – behind bars.

-- Our playdate of late has been unusually fun –
-- As an agent, I'll say, you've been a joy to outrun.
-- And while the food here is great, and the people – so nice!
-- I need a little more sunshine with my slice of life.
-- So I'm off to add one to the population I find
-- In a city of ninety-one thousand and now, eighty five.

-- The population she's going to is 91084 (because she will add one to make it 91085).

SELECT name, countrycode
FROM city
WHERE population = 91084;

-- Answer #7: Carmen Sandiego is headed to Santa Monica, USA!
--     name      | countrycode
-- --------------+-------------
--  Santa Monica | USA
